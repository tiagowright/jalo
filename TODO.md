# Genetic algorithm improvement ideas
* Consider multi-child generations, not just 1 child per loop.
* annealing for the most promising children some times
* Add some diversity preservation (duplicate filtering or crowding)


# Fixes
* annealing as default, clean up code
* annealing, is it possible to make better use of the temperature setup?
* is there a better way to do genetic?
* fix the failing test_optim
* improve a design (vs generate), fix _optimize

# Features
* jalo KEPL memory management for many layouts

* steepesthill with all column permutations (failed!)
* keygen metrics
* carpalx metrics
* corpus
* shift and delete

* README
